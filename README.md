# Online-Library-HTTP-Client
In this project, I developed a C/C++ HTTP client designed to interact with a REST API. The client operates as a command-line interface (CLI) tailored for seamless interaction with a simulated online library server. It facilitates efficient communication through HTTP requests and responses, enhancing user interaction and functionality.
